There's something wrong with the Foo. Probably a frazzled garm. Garms must be configurable.
	x Fix foo
	x make the foo testable
	x test null parameters on foo init
	x handle fooException
	x make the foo-connector configurable
	x update configuration-files with foo-configuration
	x document foo-configuration for dev/test/production
